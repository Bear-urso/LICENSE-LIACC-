# LICENSE-LIACC
LICENSE FOR OPEN INNOVATION AND COLLABORATIVE CAPITALIZATION (LIACC)
## Version 3.2
**“Encourage innovation without monopoly — with growth and fair return.”**

---

### PREAMBLE

This license aims to establish a new global standard for responsible technological innovation. It grants creators full control over their work while enabling mechanisms for fair capitalization, open collaboration, and democratized investment through Real World Asset tokenization (RWA).

The LIACC is designed to balance the interests of creators, contributors, investors, and society — decentralizing the concentration of technological and financial power.

---

### 1. DEFINITIONS

- **Creator**: The original holder of intellectual and moral rights over the work or technology.
- **Contributor**: Any party that adds significant value to the project.
- **Licensee**: Any individual or entity using the work under these terms.
- **RWA Token**: A token backed by a real-world asset, representing an economic right over future revenues.
- **Commercial Use**: Any use intended for direct or indirect profit.

---

### 2. CREATOR’S RIGHTS AND PROTECTION

- 2.1. The Creator retains all intellectual and moral property rights.
- 2.2. The work is registered on a blockchain for proof-of-existence and timestamping at every development stage.
- 2.3. Third parties are expressly forbidden from patenting, registering, or claiming ownership over the work or its direct derivatives under this framework.

---

### 3. NON-COMMERCIAL USE (COMMUNITY / ACADEMIC)

- 3.1. Permitted: Use, study, modification, non-commercial distribution, and derivative works for research, education, or personal development.
- 3.2. Condition: Clear attribution to the Creator and inclusion of this license in any redistribution or derivative work.

---

### 4. COMMERCIAL USE AND CAPITALIZATION

- 4.1. Funding: The project may be funded through the purchase of commercial licenses or RWA tokens.
- 4.2. Commercial License: Commercial use requires an explicit commercial license granted by the Creator, defining terms and revenue-sharing percentages.
- 4.3. Permitted Capitalization Models:
  - a) Direct Licensing: Payment of royalties or license fees.
  - b) RWA Tokenization: Conversion of economic rights into tradable tokens. Holders benefit from token appreciation, as defined in the project’s economic Whitepaper.
- 4.4. Mandatory Reinvestment: ≥50% of net commercial revenues must be reinvested into the project’s development (funds will be allocated to a locked treasury dedicated exclusively to project growth and feedback loops).

---

### 5. TOKENIZATION AND GOVERNANCE

- 5.1. The Creator may issue RWA tokens to capitalize the project.
- 5.2. Tokens do not confer intellectual property rights or operational control.
- 5.3. Tokens may grant voting rights on specific governance proposals (e.g., development direction), as defined in the Whitepaper.
- 5.4. An Automated Treasury backed by cryptocurrencies (e.g., WBTC, Stablecoins) will be established to ensure liquidity and stability, with transparent rules executed via smart contract.

---

### 6. CONTRIBUTIONS AND PARTICIPATION

- 6.1. Significant Contributors may receive:
  - a) Formal co-authorship credit.
  - b) A proportional share of the project’s RWA tokens, based on value added.
- 6.2. Disputes regarding contributions will be mediated by a Governance Council formed by the Creator and representatives elected by token holders.

---

### 7. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

- 7.1. Quarterly financial reports will be published on the blockchain, detailing revenues, reinvestments, and treasury status.
- 7.2. Smart contracts and tokenization mechanisms will be audited by specialized firms, and their code will be open-source.

---

### 8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

- The work is provided “AS IS,” without any express or implied warranties. The Creator is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from its use.

---

### 9. ACCEPTANCE

- Use of the work or acquisition of RWA tokens implies full and unconditional acceptance of all terms of this license.

---

### 10. JURISDICTION AND DISPUTES

- 10.1. This license shall be interpreted according to principles of good faith and international law, aiming for universal validity.

- 10.2. Dispute Resolution Through Extrajudicial and Community Mechanisms
Disputes arising from this license will be resolved through extrajudicial community governance mechanisms, as defined by the Governance Council and the processes established in the project's Whitepaper.

- 10.3. This does not imply a loss of legal certainty, but rather a conscious choice for a fair, transparent dispute resolution system that is more agile, technically aligned, and sensitive to the context of the project's ecosystem—similar to models such as arbitration, sectoral mediation, or popular juries, in which qualified peers or community representatives act as decision-makers.

- 10.4. All parties expressly agree to waive state jurisdiction, fully embracing this decentralized model—without prejudice to the individual right to appeal to the community and to propose effective mechanisms for fundamental rights in the development of this universal license, regardless of the scope and efficiency of state jurisdiction.

- 10.5. The consensus of the majority of community agreements will prevail, always guided by the preservation of fundamental rights and the objective good faith and justification of self-executing smart contracts.

- 10.6. All decisions, votes, and mediations will be recorded on a blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and traceability—essential elements for legal security in decentralized environments.

- 10.7. As an inviolable individual right, any interested party may benefit from adherence to the LIACC license or, if they disagree, abstain from participating in the project supported by it, without any obligation or penalty.

## APPENDIX A — SUGGESTED TOKENIZATION POLICY

1. **Issuance**: Tokens represent a percentage of commercial licensing revenues.
2. **Treasury**: A fund backed by stablecoins and WBTC will be automatically constituted from a defined percentage of transactions.
3. **Stability Mechanisms**: Include anti-dump safeguards (e.g., sale limits per transaction or time window) to protect the asset’s market value against speculative maneuvers.
4. **Programmed Scarcity**: Tokens sold or used in treasury mechanisms will be burned, reducing circulating supply and increasing value for remaining tokens.

---

> **NOTE**: This license is a versatile and adaptable document for each project’s governance needs. Its evolution will be guided by the Governance Council to reflect community will and project sustainability, always preserving the core principles of openness and fairness.

---

**Key Refinements Implemented**:
- Legal Clarity & Precision: Terms like “net revenues” and “extrajudicial means” add robustness.
- Consistency: Ensure all terms (e.g., “attribution,” “Whitepaper”) are used uniformly.
- Logical Flow: Reorganize clauses for natural progression (e.g., define funding before models).
- Reinforced Technical Mechanisms: Stronger language for automated treasury and token burning.
